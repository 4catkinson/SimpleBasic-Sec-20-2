'Below is a Small Basic Program that is set to copy file from one folder to a back-up folder only as long as the London branch is closed. My frame of mind was writing this based up local Portland, OR time, which is 8 hours behind London time. The back up was to occur when a button on the screen was clicked. I tried to make this so that the button would only be available during approved London afterhours back-up time.

GraphicsWindow.Title="London Afterhours Back-Up"
GraphicsWindow.Width=400
GraphicsWindow.Height=300
GraphicsWindow.BackgroundColor="Gray"
GraphicsWindow.PenColor="Red"


currently=Clock.Hour
  If currently>=0 and currently <1 Then
  
    BkUpmessage = Controls.AddButton("Afterhours Back-Up",130,130)
    Controls.ButtonClicked = backUP1
    EndIf

Sub backUp1  
  goBUTTON =Controls.LastClickedButton  
  If goBUTTON = BkUpmessage Then    
    GraphicsWindow.ShowMessage("Complete", "Afterhours Back-Up")    
    File.CopyFile("C:\Users\achri\Desktop\SB 20-3 Originals\Small Basic 20-3.txt", "C:\Users\achri\Desktop\SB 20-3 Backups")
       EndIf
       EndSub
  If currently >=1 And currently <= 13 Then
     GraphicsWindow.Hide()
       Endif
            
  If currently > 13 and currently < 24 Then
     BkUpmessage = Controls.AddButton("Afterhours Back-Up",130,130)
     Controls.ButtonClicked = backUP2
   EndIf
   
Sub backUp2  
  goBUTTON =Controls.LastClickedButton  
    If goBUTTON = BkUpmessage Then    
    GraphicsWindow.ShowMessage("Complete", "Afterhours Back-Up")    
    File.CopyFile("C:\Users\achri\Desktop\SB 20-3 Originals\Small Basic 20-3.txt", "C:\Users\achri\Desktop\SB 20-3 Backups")
       EndIf
       EndSub
